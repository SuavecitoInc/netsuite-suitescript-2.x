## GET LOCATION AVAILABLE TO TRANSFER

> get_location_available_for_transfer.ts

Creates a list of all items available at location 2, but not at location 1 and sends an email notification. This is an updated version of
<i>get_location_available.js</i>, but instead of creating the searches in the script it uses saved searches. Therefore this script can be reused by different script deployments. There was also issues in passing SQL Formulas via script paramaters.

### Setup

#### Script Deployment

Script requires 6 paramaters.
